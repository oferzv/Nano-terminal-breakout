# Nano Terminal breakout <br> ![ ](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Altium-EEBF3F?labelColor=gray&style=flat&logo=altiumdesigner&link=https://www.altium.com)

### Description
This board is a quick and dirty remix of the original Arduino 
Nano Screw Terminal Adapter. 
The main difference between this version and the original is the replacement of the SMD double-row female header with a through Hole female header. 
This change gives the possibility to solder the Nano board directly to the screw terminal breakout or use a female header that is more common and easier to solder.
<br>
The technical documentation of the original design can be found [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-screw-terminal-adapter/).


### Compatible boards
This breakout is compatible with all the boards in the Nano family.<br>
I tested this version on the following boards:
- Arduino Nano 
- Arduino Nano Every 
- Arduino Nano BLE
